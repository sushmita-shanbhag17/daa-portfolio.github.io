				<h3>Agriculture: The Backbone of Our City’s Economy</h3>
    <p>
        Agriculture is vital to our city’s economy, employing nearly 50% of the population and ensuring food security. To support this, one-fourth of the city's land is dedicated to agriculture, promoting efficient cultivation to meet urban needs. We aim to tackle key challenges such as optimizing resource use (water, fertilizers), enhancing market access, reducing supply chain inefficiencies, and integrating technology like precision farming. Addressing these areas will boost productivity, improve livelihoods, and contribute to global issues such as food security and sustainability. By investing in agriculture, we create a thriving ecosystem benefiting both rural and urban communities.

            <!-- Course Learning Reflections -->
            <article id="COURSE_LEARNING_REFLECTIONS">
                <h2 class="major">Course Learning <br>Reflections</h2>				<p>In nature, problems can be solved through repetition, like when we repeat steps in a process (iteration). Some problems can be broken into smaller, similar parts, like how a tree grows branches (recursion). Other problems require trying out different possibilities until the right solution is found, like solving a puzzle or finding your way out of a maze (backtracking).</p>

<p>Space and time efficiency are about using resources wisely. Space efficiency means using less memory so that we can handle bigger tasks on computers without running out of storage. Time efficiency means completing tasks faster, which is very important when dealing with urgent or large-scale problems. Both are important because they make systems work smoothly and save valuable resources.</p>

<p>From Chapter 2, one big takeaway is that solving big problems is easier if we divide them into smaller, more manageable parts. Reusing solutions for parts of the problem we've already solved also saves time. Additionally, some problems can be solved by making quick, smart decisions at each step without looking back too much.</p>

<p>Trees are very useful for organizing and solving problems in a structured way. A Binary Search Tree (BST) helps us find or store things quickly. AVL trees and Red-Black trees keep things balanced, which ensures that they remain efficient even when we’re working with large amounts of data. Heaps are great for finding the biggest or smallest items quickly, while Tries are useful for searching things like words or prefixes in a dictionary.</p>

<p>Arrays are one of the simplest ways to store lots of data, but we need algorithms to search, sort, or update them efficiently. These algorithms help in real-life situations, like filtering results in a search engine or organizing items in an e-commerce store.</p>

<p>Trees and graphs are both ways to organize data, but they are different. Trees have a clear hierarchy, like a family tree, and are used for things like organizing files. Graphs, on the other hand, are more like city maps, where multiple paths connect different points. Traversing a tree or graph means visiting all its parts, which is useful for searching or analyzing data.</p>

<p>Sorting and searching algorithms are everywhere in real life. Sorting helps arrange things in order, like ranking students by their scores or organizing books alphabetically. Searching is about quickly finding what you need, like locating a specific product in a store.</p>

<p>Graph algorithms like spanning trees and shortest paths are very important. Spanning trees help create efficient networks, like minimizing the amount of cable needed to connect electricity to homes. Shortest path algorithms are used in everyday life, like finding the quickest route on Google Maps or optimizing delivery routes for packages.</p>

<p>Finally, different algorithm design techniques help solve problems effectively. Breaking problems into smaller pieces makes them easier to handle. Reusing solutions avoids unnecessary work. Making step-by-step decisions helps solve problems quickly, while exploring all possibilities can help find the best solution when the situation is more complex.</p>
